# Brazilian jiu-jitsu
A summary of what I'm learning in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as a new white belt.  The information provided in this repository is from the perspective of an enthusiastic beginner.  Many of the resources that are available online are wonderful, but are for more advanced techniques.  My hope is to summarize the most basic techniques and drills to get started in the sport.
